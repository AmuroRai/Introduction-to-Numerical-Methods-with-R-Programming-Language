# Introduction to Numerical Methods with R Programming Language

This course is designed to cultivate abilities in programming and performing numerical analysis for graduate and senior undergraduate students in economics. The course will be covering tools of numerical analysis in quantitative economics models and econometrics, including random sampling, numerical integration, differentiation, root finding and optimization. The focus of the course is to pile up students' arsenals for numerical analysis, and to provide hands-on experiences of implementation with R. Each topic starts by an entry level introduction to the theoretical backgrounds, and followed by in-depth guides of implementation. Interactive widgets are integrated into the course material, intensively and extensively, to visualize relevant concepts and build-up the intuitions behind the methods taught. Students are expected to gain basic knowledges on the numerical tools, familiarize with the R programming language, obtain hands-on experience of implementation, and be able to perform numerical analysis with well conducted programming style.

I acknowledge Prof. Hung-Jen Wang at the Department of Economics, National Taiwan University for generously sharing his teaching material, and providing invaluable advices and feedback on the design of the course.

# Introduction to Numerical Methods

This course is designed to cultivate abilities in programming and performing numerical analysis for graduate and senior undergraduate students in economics. The course will be covering tools in numerical analysis, including random sampling, numerical integration, differentiation, root finding and optimization. Entry level introduction to theoretical backgrounds are provided for each topic. Then step-by-step guides on implementation with R are provided. Students are expected to gain basic knowledges on the mathematical tools of numerical analysis, familiarize with the R programming language, obtain hands-on experience of implementing the numerical tools, and perform numerical analysis with neat programming habit.
